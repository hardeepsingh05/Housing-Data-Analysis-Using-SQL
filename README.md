# Real-Estate-Data-Analysis-Using-SQL

--> In this project, I have taken this Housing Data from Kaggle and here is the link you can visit to get it: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data

--> So, to see the way of data exploration, data cleaning, and data analysis, you visit the ".sql" Code File

--> I have done data exploration and manipulation of Housing data in order to get some insights about it.
